# Sagar_s-Guide_to_Data_Science
This repository contains all the notes I have taken while studying for my M.S. Data Analytics Engineering program at George Mason University. The notes are organized by topics in Data Science and Machine Learning. The notes are in the form of markdown files and Jupyter Notebooks.

Some of these notes are prepared keeping in mind the Workshop Series, organized by Data Science and Computational Society at George Mason University. The subsequent links to the recordings of the workshops will be added as soon as they are available.

As of now, I am yet to upload all the notes. I will be uplaoding them as I keep working on them. This project is still a work in progress, and I expect to keep working on it for a very long time, even after I graduate. I will also be focusing on adding more context to the notes, and also discuss about certain aspects that are not generally covered in the textbooks, syllabus, or online MOOCs.

I hope these notes will be useful to anyone who is interested in learning Data Science and Machine Learning.

Color Coding for the topics:
* :green_book: - Notes on the topic are complete
